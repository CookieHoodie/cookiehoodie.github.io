# Portfolio Website

A portfolio website created using React for Github Pages.


# Running Locally

```sh
$ npm -i
$ npm start
```


# Deploy to Github Pages

[gh-pages package](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) is used for deployment. The following command builds and pushes the generated site to `gh-pages` branch on Github:

```sh
$ npm run deploy -- -m "Commit message"
```

Then, go to `Settings` on the repository and choose `gh-pages` and `root` as the branch to publish to Github Pages. More details could be found [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).
